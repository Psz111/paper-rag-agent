# ShizhenGPT: Towards Multimodal LLMs for Traditional Chinese Medicine

Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.
