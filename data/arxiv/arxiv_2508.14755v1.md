# Reliable generation of isomorphic physics problems using ChatGPT with   prompt-chaining and tool use

We present a method for generating large numbers of isomorphic physics
problems using ChatGPT through prompt chaining and tool use. This approach
enables precise control over structural variations-such as numeric values and
spatial relations-while supporting diverse contextual variations in the problem
body. By utilizing the Python code interpreter, the method supports automatic
solution validation and simple diagram generation, addressing key limitations
in existing LLM-based methods. We generated two example isomorphic problem
banks and compared the outcome against simpler prompt-based approaches. Results
show that prompt-chaining produces significantly higher quality and more
consistent outputs than simpler, non-chaining prompts. This work demonstrates a
promising method for efficient problem creation accessible to the average
instructor, which opens new possibilities for personalized adaptive testing and
automated content development.
