# Ask Good Questions for Large Language Models

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
the performance of dialog systems, yet current approaches often fail to provide
accurate guidance of topic due to their inability to discern user confusion in
related concepts. To address this, we introduce the Ask-Good-Question (AGQ)
framework, which features an improved Concept-Enhanced Item Response Theory
(CEIRT) model to better identify users' knowledge levels. Our contributions
include applying the CEIRT model along with LLMs to directly generate guiding
questions based on the inspiring text, greatly improving information retrieval
efficiency during the question & answer process. Through comparisons with other
baseline methods, our approach outperforms by significantly enhencing the
users' information retrieval experiences.
