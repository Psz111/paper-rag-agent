# Large Language Models are Highly Aligned with Human Ratings of Emotional   Stimuli

Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.
