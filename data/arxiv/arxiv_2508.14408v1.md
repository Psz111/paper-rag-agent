# Cognitive Surgery: The Awakening of Implicit Territorial Awareness in   LLMs

Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of
self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.
