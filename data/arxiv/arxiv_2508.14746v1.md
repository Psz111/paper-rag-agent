# MissionHD: Data-Driven Refinement of Reasoning Graph Structure through   Hyperdimensional Causal Path Encoding and Decoding

Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with
downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph
Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less
graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly
optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses
an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the
downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show
significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating
our approach as an effective pre-processing step.
