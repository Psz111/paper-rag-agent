# The Collaboration Paradox: Why Generative AI Requires Both Strategic   Intelligence and Operational Stability in Supply Chain Management

The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.
