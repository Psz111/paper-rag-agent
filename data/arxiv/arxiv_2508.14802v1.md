# Privileged Self-Access Matters for Introspection in AI

Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.
