# Post-hoc LLM-Supported Debugging of Distributed Processes

In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays
remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is
especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems.
Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can
possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease
this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in
conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations.
These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface
information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to
understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes.
Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based
Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated
explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if
developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our
demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely
accessible to all users.
