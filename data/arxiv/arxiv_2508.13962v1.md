# Learning to Use AI for Learning: How Can We Effectively Teach and   Measure Prompting Literacy for K-12 Students?

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to
apply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly.
Prior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach
students the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this
need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting
literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with
direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary
school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two
iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education
classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students'
prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and
3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the
AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory
quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in
improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in
their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1
informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and
discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could
measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for
our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for
broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess
learning effectiveness and assessment design.
