# CTA-Flux: Integrating Chinese Cultural Semantics into High-Quality   English Text-to-Image Communities

We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.
