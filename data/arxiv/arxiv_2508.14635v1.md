# Can LLM Agents Solve Collaborative Tasks? A Study on Urgency-Aware   Planning and Coordination

The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.
