# Explaining Hitori Puzzles: Neurosymbolic Proof Staging for Sequential   Decisions

We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.
