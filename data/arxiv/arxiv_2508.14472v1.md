# In2x at WMT25 Translation Task

This paper presents the open-system submission by the In2x research team for
the WMT25 General Machine Translation Shared Task. Our submission focuses on
Japanese-related translation tasks, aiming to explore a generalizable paradigm
for extending large language models (LLMs) to other languages. This paradigm
encompasses aspects such as data construction methods and reward model design.
The ultimate goal is to enable large language model systems to achieve
exceptional performance in low-resource or less commonly spoken languages.
