# Structured Agentic Workflows for Financial Time-Series Modeling with   LLMs and Reflective Feedback

Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.
