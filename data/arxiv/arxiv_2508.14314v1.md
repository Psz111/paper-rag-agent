# Zero-knowledge LLM hallucination detection and mitigation through   fine-grained cross-model consistency

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.
