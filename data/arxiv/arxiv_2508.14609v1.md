# AnchorSync: Global Consistency Optimization for Long Video Editing

Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and
temporal stability.
